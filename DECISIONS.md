# Decisions

This file records project decisions that should survive context compression, archive, or new conversations.

## D001: Agent OS Kernel plus Workflow Packs

Decision: Build a stable Agent OS Kernel and keep business scenarios in Workflow Packs.

Reason: If the architecture is rooted in one target user group, later expansion to office, operations, and developer workflows will cause expensive rewrites. Kernel objects must stay generic.

Status: Accepted.

## D002: Local-first with collaboration-ready data model

Decision: MVP is local-first and has no cloud sync, but the data model includes Actor, Role, AuditLog, ShareableRun, and import/export packages.

Reason: Team collaboration will matter, but cloud sync would distract MVP execution. Collaboration-ready local records avoid a future data model rewrite.

Status: Accepted.

## D003: Capability-specific permission engine

Decision: Permissions are not a single full-access switch. File, network, browser, email, drive, terminal, and Computer Use permissions must be separately controlled.

Reason: Ordinary users need clear, task-appropriate control. High-risk capabilities such as email send, file mutation, browser form submission, terminal execution, and Computer Use need separate review.

Status: Accepted.

## D004: Automatic memory with auditability

Decision: Memory is captured automatically, but every memory item needs source, scope, sensitivity, lifecycle, and deletion/edit controls.

Reason: Memory is one of the most important agent features. A hidden or unscoped memory system will create trust, privacy, and correctness problems.

Status: Accepted.

## D005: Template-first extension model

Decision: Workflow Packs are manifest/template/schema/protocol based in MVP. Arbitrary third-party executable code is excluded.

Reason: Third-party code plugins can hide malicious behavior. If code extensions are added later, they require sandboxing, signatures, permissions, review, and stable APIs.

Status: Accepted.

## D006: DeepSeek-first provider strategy

Decision: Build a provider abstraction for multiple mainstream models, but optimize first for DeepSeek.

Reason: DeepSeek-specific thinking mode, Pro/Flash routing, context caching, long context, cost behavior, and reasoning/tool-call handling should shape the first-class experience.

Status: Accepted.

## D007: Import/export is part of collaboration foundation

Decision: Support Workspace Package and Run Archive import/export.

Reason: Without cloud sync, import/export is the safest early collaboration bridge. It also tests whether tasks, evidence, outputs, approvals, and memory candidates are portable.

Status: Accepted.

## D008: Latency Controller is part of the kernel

Decision: The kernel should distinguish Fast Path, Workflow Path, and Deep Work Path.

Reason: OpenClaw-style broad capability loading can feel slow. Ordinary users need fast first results, while complex work still needs deep planning and verification.

Status: Accepted.

## D009: Local unlock and agent token

Decision: The app needs local unlock plus an auto-generated local agent token.

Reason: Browser extensions, local API, Computer Use bridges, and sidecar processes need secure local authentication. Tokens should be generated locally, stored securely, rotatable, and auditable.

Status: Accepted.

## D010: Desktop stack

Decision: Use Tauri + React + TypeScript + Rust sidecar as the desktop stack.

Reason: The project is local-first, permission-heavy, and needs native filesystem/process/security boundaries. Tauri keeps the desktop app lighter than Electron, React/TypeScript supports a polished workbench UI, and Rust is a good fit for the local kernel, event store, policy engine, and sidecar adapters.

Status: Accepted.

## D011: First Operations Management workflow

Decision: The first workflow is an Operations Briefing workflow that turns a local evidence folder into an evidence-backed management brief, anomaly table, action plan, and exportable report package.

Reason: This workflow validates the core Agent OS capabilities without hardcoding an industry into the kernel: file ingestion, memory retrieval, data/document analysis, evidence traceability, DeepSeek routing, verification, artifact generation, permissions, and run archive export.

Status: Accepted.

## D012: MVP import behavior

Decision: MVP supports full export, import preview, template/workflow import, and read-only run archive replay. Imported memories become reviewable memory candidates and are not written automatically.

Reason: Import/export is needed for collaboration, but direct import of data, permissions, or long-term memory is risky. Preview-first import validates package design while keeping the active workspace safe.

Status: Accepted.

## D013: Computer Use rollout

Decision: Computer Use ships behind an experimental high-risk flag in MVP. Screenshot/inspect is allowed with explicit permission; mouse/keyboard control requires per-step approval and cannot run in full auto mode.

Reason: Computer Use is powerful but risky for ordinary users. The first version should prove the policy, audit, and UI controls before enabling broader automation.

Status: Accepted.

## D014: PDF Unicode strategy for MVP

Decision: Keep PDF export lightweight and ASCII-safe in MVP. Markdown and HTML exports are the full-fidelity Unicode report formats.

Reason: Bundling a CJK-capable font affects app size, license review, rendering quality, and cross-platform packaging. Runtime OS font discovery adds platform variability. The current PDF path remains useful for simple ASCII-safe handoff while HTML/Markdown preserve Chinese and other Unicode content.

Status: Accepted.

## D015: Codex bridge runtime lifecycle for MVP

Decision: Codex bridge runs as an external compatible loopback HTTP service in MVP. The desktop app does not spawn, install, or supervise a sidecar process.

Reason: The bridge touches screen pixels, input control, and source-backed search. Keeping it external makes lifecycle, trust, logging, upgrades, and local operator consent explicit while the contract stabilizes. A managed stdio sidecar can be revisited after token hardening, signing, and process supervision are designed.

Status: Accepted.

## D016: Memory Studio conflict actions

Decision: Memory Studio offers three explicit conflict actions: link-and-accept, merge-and-accept, and replace-and-accept. Link keeps all visible memories. Merge writes a new merged memory from the preview and tombstones selected source memories. Replace writes the candidate as the new memory and tombstones selected target memories.

Reason: Memory conflicts should not be silently collapsed. The user needs a visible choice between preserving relationships, consolidating duplicates, and superseding older records. All paths preserve append-only candidate resolutions, memory creation, links, and tombstones for audit.

Status: Accepted.

## D017: v0.1-alpha feature freeze for open-source release

Decision: Stop adding new product capabilities before the first GitHub open-source release. Work is limited to release hygiene, documentation, safety clarification, verification, packaging, and bug fixes required to keep the existing scope buildable and honest.

Reason: The project exists to provide serious DeepSeek-first domestic model support, not to become a feature pile. A credible GitHub alpha needs clear positioning, reproducible builds, safety boundaries, and transparent limitations more than additional features.

Status: Accepted.

## D018: Apache-2.0 license for public release

Decision: Publish DeepSeek Agent OS under Apache-2.0.

Reason: The project is infrastructure-style open source for DeepSeek-first agent support. Apache-2.0 keeps contribution and reuse permissive while adding an explicit patent grant that is useful for agent runtime, desktop, and integration work.

Status: Accepted.

## D019: Source-only first alpha

Decision: Publish v0.1-alpha as source-only release material first. Do not attach unsigned Windows debug installer artifacts unless the maintainer explicitly approves that later.

Reason: The current Windows installer is useful for local validation, but a public open-source alpha should avoid distributing unsigned binaries before signing, artifact provenance, and release packaging policy are mature. Source build instructions are enough for the first credible GitHub baseline.

Status: Accepted.
